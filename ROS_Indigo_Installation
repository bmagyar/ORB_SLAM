Check and Install following dependencies

# sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev 
# sudo apt-get install libsuitesparse-dev

1.) Create a folder - say "orb_slam_ws" and create a "src" folder inside it.

2.) Intialize the folder as catkin workspace through the following command : 
# catkin_init_workspace

3.) Then clone the package (file size :49mb) inside the src folder using following command : 
# git clone https://github.com/srv/ORB_SLAM.git

4.) Once cloned, cut and paste the two folders (g2o and orb_slam) and a readme file from ORB_SLAM folder to src folder (i.e in src folder itself- and delete the ORB_SLAM folder).

5.) # cd .. (to your catkin_workspace)

6.) compile and build using # catkin_make

7.) Before launching orb_slam, go to orb_slam/Data and extract ORBvoc.yml file from ORBvoc.yml.tar.gz

8.) Source setup from workspace and launch orb_slam using command :
# roslaunch orb_slam orb_slam.launch

(If above doesn't work, simply go into the folder orb_slam_ws/src/orb_slam/launch and type # roslaunch orb_slam.launch )
